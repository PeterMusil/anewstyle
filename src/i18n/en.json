  "faq.q1": "I have a designer lamp, but the visible power cord bothers me. How do you solve this with your panels?",
  "faq.a1": "<strong>BASIC</strong> and <strong>DELUXE</strong> panels are designed for maximum design purity. Their <strong>depth hides the socket and power cord</strong> behind the panel. You simply hang it like a picture and plug it in – no visible cables.",
  "faq.q2": "Do I need to worry about the placement of the power source and cables during installation?",
  "faq.a2": "<strong>BASIC</strong> and <strong>DELUXE</strong> panels are designed for maximum simplicity. Just <strong>hang them on the wall</strong> like a picture and plug them into a socket. All components (including the socket) are hidden behind the panel.",
  "faq.q3": "LED lifespan is stated as 30-50,000 hours. But what happens when the LED lighting fades after years?",
  "faq.a3": "Our panels can be easily <strong>disassembled and repaired</strong>. In case of LED diode fading, components can be simply <strong>replaced</strong>. This is a major advantage over common, non-repairable LED lights.",
  "faq.q4": "Is it possible to order panels in custom sizes?",
  "faq.a4": "Definitely! We offer <strong>custom manufacturing</strong>. Contact us with your <strong>size requirements</strong> and we will prepare a non-binding price offer.",
  "faq.q5": "Are the panels suitable for humid environments (e.g., bathrooms)?",
  "faq.a5": "Our panels are <strong>moisture-resistant</strong> thanks to nano impregnation and can be installed in wellness areas or bathrooms, but we do not <strong>recommend</strong> them for <strong>direct contact</strong> with running water.",
  "faq.q6": "Can the panels be controlled remotely?",
  "faq.a6": "Yes, the <strong>Deluxe</strong> version is dimmable and can be controlled using the included <strong>RF remote control or mobile app</strong> (depending on the chosen version). The <strong>Slim</strong> version uses a <strong>classic switch</strong> and <strong>Basic</strong> is controlled by a <strong>touch switch</strong>.",
  "faq.q7": "Is panel impregnation necessary after installation?",
  "faq.a7": "The panels are treated with special <strong>nano impregnation</strong> from the factory, which protects them against moisture and facilitates cleaning.",
  "faq.q8": "Is the panel heavy?",
  "faq.a8": "Despite using natural stone, the panels are lightweight because they use ultra-thin veneers. The panels are easy to handle and hang on the wall. Their weight ranges from <strong>14kg</strong> in the smallest SLIM version size L."
